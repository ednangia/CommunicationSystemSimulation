# Communication System Simulation Project

This project involves Simulink and MATLAB simulations for testing the performance of a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) based communication system over a Gilbert channel. The simulations allow performance evaluation under various error correction coding techniques, transmitters, and receivers.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following software and toolboxes:

- **MATLAB** and **Simulink**
- **Communication Toolbox**
- **Control Systems Toolbox**
