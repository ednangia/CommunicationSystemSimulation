# Communication System Simulation Project
Simulink and Matlab simulation for testing BPSK based communication system performance over a Gilbert channel.
We can performance under various error correction coding techniques, transmitters and recievers. 
Requires:
MATLAB and Simulink
  Communication Toolbox
  Control Systems Toolbox
